Add the index.html and style.css files to a new Visual Studio Code project.

Create a github repository. Once created add the following:
- A working .gitignore file
- A README.md file with an awesome title and description
- A good number of commits with descriptive messages
- Branches for each feature/team member

Refactor the CSS (style.css) to SCSS (style.scss) using the SCSS features you've learned. 
Note: You can also split up your .scss files and make use of imports in your style.scss file. Use any folder structure you feel is best to keep your work organised.
